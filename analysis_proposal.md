Having a working assembly for _Xiphister mucosus_ would allow for comparative analyses between _X. mucosus_ and other members within the Stichaedae family. The Stichaedae family contains species with varying dietary needs, assembling the _X. mucosus_ genome would allow for closer examination of regions that govern digestive enzymne production and metabolism across various Stichaedae lineages. This would add an extra layer to data collected from the enzymatic assays done previously on _X. mucosus_. Hopefully, we will eventually be able to map the sequence changes on a phylogenetic map in order to see what variations lie within the family.   

I am proposing assembling a genome for _Xiphister mucosus_ by merging Pacific Biocience long-read datasets with Illumina short-read datasets. The _X. mucosus_ was collected in Washington state and the DNA was extracted by Dr. Joseph Herras, and the sample was sent to Pacific Bio for sequencing. The sequence data was then stored on the synology for future analyses. I believe that the program FALCON would be the best tool for assembing the _X. mucosus_ genome. FALCON is a free command-line based software that is used for assembling long PacBio reads, and the software is already downloaded on the HPC.
